## My Objectives
- Recreate desired page layout
- Populate articles via JSON
- Add animations, including a drop down menu, that will make the page easy to navigate for the user
- Make responsive for mobile devices
- Ensure that the code is easily understood - include comments where needed

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Approach
My approach was firstly to put together the page structure via HTML and fill in the main content needed.

I then worked on styling key areas such as the header and text, followed by the sidebar.

Most of my time was spent on the navigation. I felt a dropdown made sense for the "More" link, and I spent a lot of time researching the best way to make a dropdown menu fully accessible but all of the solutions I found required an immense amount of Javascript code which I felt took the project outside the scope of "code is easily understood".

Once most of the styling was complete I tackled the Javascript, to create the XMLHttpRequest needed to access the JSON data provided. It was then simply a case of using that data to populate the articles, and style them as needed.

Finally, a quick code clean up to remove any css code I had never used.

## To do if I had more time:
- [ ] Spend a lot of time studying web accessibility, and trying to find the best solution for the dropdown menu
